# Final Project

## Brief


* Start working on your projects on Wednesday
* Send the instructors your repo' links!
* Work until Wednesday or Thursday (if you dare - just make sure it works for the pres' üòâ )
* Presentations on Thursday morning - **please send us your song**
* Team retros on Thursday afternoon - you're running these
* Choose your own team - no bigger than 4 + **no repeated teams from previous projects**
* Solo is an option - by all means



## Rules


### Tech


* Choose your own tech stack - but we **strongly** encourage full stack with Java on the back-end. 
 - Likely to use React, java, mongodb. Could try streams? (Parallel streams)? filter, reduce, limit on api stuff. could add in stadium entry, make making a map easier?

* We heavily encourage 3rd party libraries of all kinds for JS or Java - you choose. Explore some ideas - we're **really** keen to see what you find. If you do, it makes a great topic for the presentation.
 - Found these that may help in the exploration ideas:
* Material-ui
* React-grids?
* React-geo  / pigeon maps  / google-map-react / react-mapbox / react-maps
* React-fontawesome?
* Slate?


## SGNN News / Pitch notes

What'**s** **G**oi**n**' O**n** News have asked you to build a web application to allow them to upload the latest ~~Scottish~~ ‚öΩÔ∏è **FOOTBALL** ‚öΩÔ∏è news.

## MVP

They want to be able to:

- Add, Edit and Remove Journalists
- Add, Edit and Remove Articles
- Store latest results and league table data

For the front end of the website, users should be able to:

- View a list of articles, ordered by date. (Newest first!)
- Filter articles based on category/league
- Click through to the full story
- View latest scores and league table

(Each Article might have a headline, summary paragraph, and the full story along with the journalist who wrote it - and any other fields you want to add.)

## Project Extensions

- use the data at api.football-data.org to fill the scores, table team info with real info (You can use an external API but only if you pull the data into your own back-end and use it from there.)
- Search for articles where the title includes a particular search term
- Filter articles by journalist
- Filter articles by category, which can be added by SGNN
- Track how many times an article has been read, and display a list of most popular articles
- _Paginate_ your article list - display a certain number of articles per page, with a page number, and navigation to go to the next and previous page.
